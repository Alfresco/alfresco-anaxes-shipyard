# Guidelines

The Anaxes project provides various guidelines from creating Docker images through to recommended project structures.

## Repositories

There are no further guidelines regarding repositories over and above the [standard policies](https://w3.alfresco.com/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=AEO&title=Code+Storage+Policies+and+Locations).

However, to avoid a proliferation of Docker image and Helm chart updates it is highly recommended to manage the deployment artifacts in a separate GitHub repository and suffix the repository name with "-deployment".

For example, the deployment artifacts for the code in "alfresco-dsync-services" should reside in a repository named "alfresco-dsync-services-deployment".
