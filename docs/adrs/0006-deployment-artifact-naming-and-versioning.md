# 6. Deployment Artifact Naming and Versioning

Date: 2017-11-17

## Status

Proposed

## Context

To ensure we use a consistent naming and versioning scheme for docker images and helm charts across the company we need to produce a set of guidelines that teams should follow when creating their deployment artifacts.

## Decision

TODO: details

The recommedations made in the [report] have been formally stated in the [official guidelines].

## Consequences

As a result of this decision we will have consistently named docker images whose owners are easily determined. The contents of the image are also easily identifable by the version/tag used.

As a result of this decision we will also have consistently named helm charts that follow the semantic versioning scheme.
