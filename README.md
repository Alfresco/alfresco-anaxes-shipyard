# Welcome to Anaxes

The purpose of the Anaxes project is to provide a set of guidelines, best practices and artifacts Alfresco engineering teams can use to produce deliverables ready for deployment into Kubernetes.

Whilst this project is primarliy aimed at internall engineering teams the contents may also be useful to the community and customers.

# Using Anaxes

This section describes the parts Anaxes is comprised of and provides links to where you'll find more information.

## Guidelines

To ensure we have a consistent approach to building, deploying and running deliverables from each delivery team we need to have a set of guidelines we all adhere to.

TODO: add and link to guidelines README

## Docker Images

Every delivery team will be producing Docker images in order to eliminate duplication and provide consistency the Anaxes project has defined several base Docker images that teams must use as their starting point.

## Helm Charts

Helm is a packaging technology that will be used to deploy Alfresco products to Kubernetes.

Whilst individual teams will be responsible for producing helm charts to package their deliverables the Anaxes project also provides some examples.
