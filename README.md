# Welcome to Anaxes Shipyard

The purpose of the Anaxes Shipyard project is to provide a set of guidelines, best practices and artifacts Alfresco engineering teams can use to produce deliverables ready for deployment into [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io).

Whilst this project is primarliy aimed at internal engineering teams the contents may also be useful to the community, partners and customers.

# What's in this Project?

This section describes the parts Anaxes Shipyard is comprised of and provides links to where you'll find more information. 

## Guidelines

To ensure we have a consistent approach to building, deploying and running deliverables from each delivery team we need to have a set of [guidelines](./docs/guidelines/README.md) we all adhere to.

## Docker Images

Components of the Alfresco platform should produce [Docker](https://www.docker.com) images as part of their build and release pipeline. In order to eliminate duplication and provide consistency the Anaxes Shipyard project will define several base Docker images that components can use as the starting point for their images.

The Alfresco [base Java docker image](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-docker-base-java) defines the starting point for any product/service that requires Java.

## Helm Charts

[Helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm) is a packaging technology that will be used to deploy Alfresco products to Kubernetes.

Similar to producing Docker images, components should also produce helm charts to package their deliverables. The Anaxes Shipyard project also provides some examples.

# Getting Started

## How to run a Kubernetes Cluster

### Locally via Minikube

#### Download Tools for Local Minikube Deployment

1. Install Prerequisites for Minikube:

    a. [Hypervisor](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/#install-a-hypervisor)

    b. [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)

    c. [Helm Client](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#installing-helm)

    d. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/#desktop)

1. Install [Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases).

#### Start Minikube

1. Start Kubernetes Cluster:

```bash
minikube start
```

*Note*: When starting Minikube it is recommended to give it plenty of memory for hosting containers. You can do this by adding parameter --memory=6144 to minikube start command.

2. Install [(Helm) Tiller](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#installing-tiller).

3. If you want to access the dashboard:

```bash
 minikube dashboard
```

#### Stop and Delete Minikube Resources

1. Stop Kubernetes Cluster:

```bash
minikube stop
```

2. Delete Kubernetes Cluster:

```bash
minikube delete
```

*Notes*:

1. Features that require a Cloud Provider will not work in Minikube. (e.g. LoadBalancers)
1. Minikube runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a VM on your laptop.

*Useful resource*: [Running Kubernetes Locally via Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/).

### In AWS via Kops

#### Download Tools for AWS Deployment

1. Install prerequisites for `kops`

    a. [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)

    b. [Helm Client](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#installing-helm)

    c. [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) (Note: install `awscli`, and not `aws-shell`).

    d. A compatible version of [python](https://www.python.org)

1. Install [kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops#installing)

#### Set Up and Start Kops Cluster

1. Set Up Required Resources

    * Create [AWS resources](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/aws.md#setup-your-environment) needed for your cluster.

    Note: using a gossip-based cluster is simpler than one where you need to create DNS resources.

1. [Create the cluster](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/aws.md#create-cluster-configuration)

    This will take a few minutes to create the EC2 instances, set up Kubernetes and make the ELB available.

    Note: currently you need a default RSA ssh key prior to creating the cluster.

1. Install [(Helm) Tiller](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#installing-tiller).

#### Stop and Delete AWS Resources

1. [Delete the cluster](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/aws.md#delete-the-cluster)

    This deletes the EC2 instances and ELB.

1. Delete the S3 Bucket

    If you followed the advice to create a versioned bucket, you will need to [delete all the versioned objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/delete-or-empty-bucket.html) before deleting the bucket.

## Check out the Hello World App example

To practically demonstrate the use of the guidelines and artifacts generated by Anaxes Shipyard a [Hello World App](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-anaxes-hello-world) has been produced.
