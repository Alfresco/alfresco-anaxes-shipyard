# Contributing to Anaxes Shipyard

Ways to contribute would be by submitting pull requests, reporting issues and creating suggestions.
When you want to report a new issue or create a suggestion, please check if it was not reported already in Github Issues. 
In the case of a defect please provide steps to reproduce the issue, as well as the expected result and the actual one.
If you would like a feature to be added or changed, use Github Issues as well.

If you'd like a hand at trying to implement features yourself, please validate your changes by running the tests.
To enable us to quickly review and accept your pull requests, always create one pull request per issue and link the issue in the pull request. Never merge multiple requests in one unless they have the same root cause. Pull requests should contain tests whenever possible.
