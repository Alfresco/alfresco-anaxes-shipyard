Ways to contribute would be by submitting pull requests, reporting issues and creating suggestions.
In the case of a defect please provide steps to reproduce the issue, as well as the expected result and the actual one.

If you'd like a hand at trying to implement features yourself, please validate your changes by running the tests.
Also pull requests should contain tests whenever possible.
